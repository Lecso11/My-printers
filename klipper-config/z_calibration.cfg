[z_calibration]

## update these variable according to the documentation here https://github.com/protoloft/klipper_z_calibration
## you then should call CALIBRATE_Z as one of the last lines on your PRINT_START to set the Z offset dinamically

#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for clicking the nozzle on the Z endstop.
#probe_nozzle_x: 70
#probe_nozzle_y: 255
nozzle_xy_position: 70,255

#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for clicking the probe's switch on the Z endstop.
#(probe_switch_x should be minus 5mm from the probe_nozzle_x)
#probe_switch_x: 65
#(probe_switch_y should be minus 10.5mm from the probe_nozzle_y)
#probe_switch_y: 236
switch_xy_position: 65,236

#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for probing on the print surface
#   (e.g. the center point) These coordinates will be adapted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh. It will raise an error if there is no
#   probe_bed site and no bed_mesh with a relative_reference_index
#   configured.
#probe_bed_x: default from relative_reference_index of bed_mesh
#probe_bed_y: default from relative_reference_index of bed_mesh

#   The trigger point offset of the used klicky switch.
#   This needs to be fined out manually.
#   Higher number = more squish
switch_offset: 0.35
#0.45 #PLA FR4
#0.35 #ABS PEI

#   The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset.
#   If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop!
#   The default is 1.0 mm.
max_deviation: 1

#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values
#   will be averaged. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples: 5

#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_tolerance: default from [probe] section

#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_tolerance_retries: default from [probe] section

#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_result: default from [probe] section

#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's configuration.
clearance: 10

#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) used for probing move. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
position_min: -1

#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
speed: 100

#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#lift_speed: 100

#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is activated. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
#probing_speed: default homing_speed from [stepper_z] section.

#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
#probing_second_speed: default second_homing_speed from [stepper_z] section.

#   Distance to backoff (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
probing_retract_dist: 1

#   If true, the first probing is done faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get faster down and the result is not recorded as a probing sample. The default is false.
probing_first_fast: true

#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to attach the probe.
start_gcode: Dock_Probe_Unlock

#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probing on the
#   mag-probe. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be
#   used to attach the probe after probing on the nozzle and before probing on the mag-probe.
before_switch_gcode: Attach_Probe

#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to detach the probe afterwards.
